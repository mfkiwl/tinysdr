# Overview
Here we provide FPGA projects for two demos using TinySDR.

- [LoRa Modulator](https://github.com/uw-x/lora-modulator): Using this demo we can generate LoRa compatible packets on TinySDR and receive them using SX1276 receiver.
- [FSK Modulator](https://github.com/mehrdadh/fsk-modulator): Using this demo we can generate FSK packets compatible with BLE standard and receive them on any smartphone.

You can aslo use the pre-generated FPGA bit stream here to try these demos.
